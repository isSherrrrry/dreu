title: Week 4

In week 4, I found that the chrome extension does not allow multiple pages. Thus, I tried to use the hide() function, but it did not work in extensions. Therefore, I changed to an early and simpler chrome extension version, V2. Afterward, we changed our idea of uploading the data collect to the server via plug-in to having a CSV file downloaded. I completed implementing the functions, and the extension worked with V2. However, on Friday, I found that chrome did not accept any more extensions in V2 (private extension) starting June 2022. As a result, I had to change my code to the newest chrome extension version, V3.
