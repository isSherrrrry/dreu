title: Week 9
---

In week 9, I mainly worked on publishing the plug-in and writing the outline for the final report. The plug-in was sent to review, but then was rejected. It was because of a premission issue. Thus, I have modified the required premission and some functions, and sent it for review again. I also finished the outline and started writing the final paper for the DREU program. In the meantime, it was also my last week in-person at Tufts' campus, as my mentor would not be coming to the campus next week. I went back to ATL on Saturday.
