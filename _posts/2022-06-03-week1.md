title: Week 2

During week 2, I focused on developing the extension. While I was watching the course, I finished the extension's HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript used for page transitions early in the week. I also completed the chrome extension manifest file and logos, and I started testing it via chrome developer mode. Later in the week, I finished writing the stopwatch function for recording the total time for users. The complicating part of the code was about formatting time, while there were no specific algorithms used. Additionally, I finished writing the code for adding listeners to the browser and having the activity tracking ready via JS output.
