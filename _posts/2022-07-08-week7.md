title: Week 7

In week 7, I continue improved the plug-inâ€™s survey page. I changed the UI of the survey page and added the specific scales for rating the webpages. I also excluded search engine pages for prompting the survey, and restricted that participants can only rate each webpage once. The plug-in was finished again. I also made an installation tutorial video for the plug-in. Additionally, I started working on publishing the plug-in.
