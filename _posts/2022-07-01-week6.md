In week 6, I firstly finished a web scraper that reads in the excel form exported and scrapping the information from the URLs recorded. Particularly, I used Selenium for web scrapping. We also had a discussion in the project overview, and decided to add a function to the plug-in, which was to show a short survey for participants to rate the pages after them visited each site. I finished the development for this new function over the weekend.
