title: Week 8

In week 8, I have finished all the required documentation for the plug-in. I started working on designing the post-study survey in Qualtrics with my mentor. We had a few meetings and I finished putting all the questions and survey logics to Qualtrics. Moreover, we decided to add a function that participants could rate the keywords they search from the search engine. To add the function, I had to modify the plug-in again to pass the keywords to the survey from the URL. I finished modifying the plug-in. However, since we have not yet found a platform to put our CTF questions, I could not decide the break point (which question are those keywords for) for the keywords as I didn't know the url for next question.
