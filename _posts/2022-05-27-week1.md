On the first day, Dr. Votipka toured me around Tufts and welcomed me to the lab. I was introduced to the project and my tasks. My first task was to develop a chrome extension that can record users' browser activities as well as scrape the websites they visited. However, since I did not have any browser extension development experience, I found a course on Udemy and started learning it. In the meanwhile, we talked about the project and changed the idea of recording browser activity while scraping to record the browser activity only. We planned to assign a user id to each participant and upload the data collected to a server via the plug-in. I created a Figma prototype for the extension, where we have four pages in total: input field for participant id, start/end tracking, tracking result, and end page.
