## About Me

Hi there! My name is **Yijun Liu**, and I am currently a rising junior at **Emory University** double majoring in **Math/CS and Sociology**. I am expecting to graduate in May 2024 from Emory College at Emory University.   
This summer, I participated in the **DREU program at Tufts University**, Computer Science Department in person. Boston is a great and historical place to live. I live right next to Tufts with 2 Tufts graduate students. After the program, I plan to go back to Virginia to visit my high school and my relatives, as well as attending the KDD 2022 conference as a student assistant in the Web team.

## About My Project

During the summer, I am working on the **JustGoogleIt** project with James Mattei, a graduate student in the lab. The project aims to investigate studentsâ€™ behaviors in searching (googling) Computer Security questions. We want to collect participants' data in terms of the sites they visited, the time spent on each site, percentage of each site viewed, and the content of each site. We planned to accomplish the following during the summer: 
1. Develop a Google Chrome extension that can be used to monitor browser activities (sites they visited, the time spent on each site, and percentage of each site viewed);
2. Develop a Web Scraper to scrape the information on visited sites;
3. Run a sample experiment with Tufts CS-Security summer school students; the tool is expected to be used in a large experiment in the fall.
