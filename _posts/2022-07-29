title: Week 10
---

I was working on writing my final report paper in week 10 according to the outline we drafted. I was writing the paper via LaTex, following the sturcture of a system design paper. The study that I was currently work on did not have much written resources, so I had to work on them mostly myself. I also came back to Atlanta.
