title: Week 5

In week 5, I mainly worked on changing the plug-in to V3. The main difference between developing in V2 and V3 were its APIs and privacy policies in the manifest file. Another issue I found was to export the CSV file from the plug-in as most of the traditional JavaScript approaches failed. Later, I found an external package that had an API to export to an excel form. I have successfully completed the plug-in. The plug-in is a browser activity tracker for the CTF Resource Use research project at Tufts Security and Privacy Lab. The extension collects the URLs visited, the percentages of webpages viewed by users, and the time stamps on each visit. There will also be a short survey asking questions about the webpage just viewed for non-search engine URLs.
