Early in the week, I finished the function of getting the percentage of the page viewed. Last week, I purposed to add a "pause" function to allow participants to pause during taking tests. Therefore, this week, I mainly focused on adding the pause function. Firstly, I modified my code for the stopwatch to allow it to pause. I also changed the logic of my system by adding a finish button and changed the code accordingly in JavaScript. Next, I need to be able to remove the listeners that monitor the browser when paused and add listeners when starting again. In the past, I only added listeners to the chrome extension and listen to the activities. I tried to remove the listeners with the pause button, but it turned out that I would just end the session when paused and was unable to start again. Thus, to add the pause function, I changed the structure of my code, adding listeners each time when users viewed the page and removed when users stop viewing the page. As a result, when the user hits "pause", no listeners would be added.
