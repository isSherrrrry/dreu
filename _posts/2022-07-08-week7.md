title: Week 7
---

In week 7, I continue improved the plug-inâ€™s survey page. I changed the UI of the survey page and added the specific scales for rating the webpages. I also excluded search engine pages for prompting the survey, and restricted that participants can only rate each webpage once. The plug-in was finished again. I also made an installation tutorial video for the plug-in. Additionally, I started working on publishing the plug-in. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16162040/178615214-d5a828a6-6fa2-4b85-83c9-b1059ad77d2c.png)
